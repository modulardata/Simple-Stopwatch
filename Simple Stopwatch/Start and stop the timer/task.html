<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Get those coding sneakers on! In this stage, it's time to lace up your JavaScript skills and implement the start and stop functionalities for our stopwatch app. Picture this: you're gearing up runners for the race of a lifetime, and every millisecond counts!</p>
<p>Your mission is to display the crucial metrics of time: minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, all in a sleek and user-friendly interface. When the runners hit that stop button, it's not game over! They should be able to pause, catch their breath, and then seamlessly resume from the exact moment they left off.</p>
<p>So, strap in, get ready to code like the wind, and let's build a stopwatch that'll have those runners race-ready in no time! ðŸš€ðŸ’¨</p>
