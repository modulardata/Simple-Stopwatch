In the third stage, we're continuing the power of JavaScript to the track.</p><p>🏃‍♂️ <strong>Reset - Ready, Set, Go Again!</strong> When the runners need a fresh start, they hit the reset button. Your task is to make sure that this button sends our timer back to the starting line, ready for the next lap.</p><p>🏁 <strong>Lap - Keep Track of Your Progress!</strong> Every time the athletes complete a lap, they want to capture that moment. Implement the lap functionality to record these lapped times as a list item. Each press should add a new achievement to the list, showcasing their progress with each stride.</p><p>📋 <strong>List - Where Victories are Documented!</strong> To display these triumphant laps, introduce an unordered or ordered list in the body of our app. This list will serve as a testament to the dedication and hard work of our aspiring racers. Let the victories stack up in style!</p><p>🎽 <strong>Race Day Prep Mode: Engaged!</strong> Imagine the excitement of race day approaching.
